First of all, own language makes us smarter and more cultural. It gives us an opportunity to think about its appearing and compare it with your mother tongue.

Secondly, English allows us to talk to all people and meet new friends. Just imagine, you have came to USA and you got many new guys because you know English and can fluently speak it. Thats amazing!
